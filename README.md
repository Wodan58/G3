Accounting Made Easy

This project shows an application built in the
[Joy Programming Language](https://github.com/Wodan58/Joy).

Disclaimer
----------

The source code currently meets the requirements of the application.
The code itself is not a showcase of beautiful programming in Joy and
after some cosmetic changes it is even more uglyfied than it was.
This will be dealt with when there are new requirements.
